# resfun-panelists-code
This repository contains the code for the resfun-panelists project.

The code in scrapper-1 scrapes the panel names along with their respective panelists and subsequently saves the data as a csv file. The website scrapped here is a 2021 version of https://gacr.cz/o-ga-cr/poradni-organy/panely/, as archived on the wayback machine.

The code in scrapper-2 is almost identical and achieves the same with the 2022 version of the website mentioned before.
 
The resultant csv files contain 4 columns with the names of the panels, panelists, date and url of the source webpage.
